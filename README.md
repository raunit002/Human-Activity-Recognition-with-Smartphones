## Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Smartphones

## Project Objective
The objective of the Human Activity Recognition project is to build a machine learning model that can classify different types of physical activities—like walking, sitting, or standing—based on sensor data collected from smartphones. This technology has broad applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments, where detecting and analyzing physical activity can provide valuable insights into user behavior and well-being.

## Dataset Overview
Dataset: UCI Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones
Features: This dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings collected from 30 volunteers as they performed various activities. Each participant was asked to perform six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down) while wearing a smartphone on their waist.

### Input Data: Accelerometer and gyroscope signals in the X, Y, and Z directions
### Labels: Activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, lying)

## Project Flowchart
Here’s a simplified flowchart describing the main stages in the HAR project.
